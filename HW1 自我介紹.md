# AI in My Field: Learning and Application

## 👤 Self-Introduction
Hello! My name is **Jessline (胡祯恩)**, and I am currently an **overseas Chinese student at NQU** pursuing a **master’s degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering**. My research interests include **deep learning** and **medical image analysis**.  

I have completed several AI-related projects, including:  
- **Facial Emotion Detection** (Undergraduate project) – Built using **Roboflow**.  
- **COVID-19 Detection in CT Scans** – Applied **deep learning models (VGG, ResNet)**.  
- **Skin Cancer Classification** – Currently working on **CNN, EfficientNet, and VGG/ResNet** models.  

## 🎯 Motivation for Taking This Course  
I enrolled in this course because I want to:  
1. **Deepen my understanding of AI and its applications** in real-world scenarios.  
2. **Enhance my programming skills**, especially in Python and deep learning frameworks like `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch`.  
3. **Explore AI-powered tools** to optimize my research process.  

## 🧠 How AI Applies to My Field  
AI plays a significant role in **medical image analysis**, particularly in:  
- **Disease Diagnosis** – AI helps detect abnormalities in medical images (e.g., CT scans, MRI).  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** – Enhances model interpretability for clinical decision-making.  
- **Medical Data Processing** – AI automates feature extraction and classification.  

For example, in my **COVID-19 Detection project**, I trained a deep learning model using **CT scan datasets**, which helped distinguish between COVID-19 and normal lung conditions with high accuracy.  

## 🔬 AI Project/Research Goals  
I want to develop an **AI-based skin cancer detection system** that can:  
- Accurately classify different types of skin cancer using **CNN and EfficientNet**.  
- Implement **Explainable AI techniques (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME)** to enhance transparency.  
- Deploy the model as a **web-based diagnostic tool**.  

## 📚 How This Course Will Help Me  
This course will support my research by:  
- Teaching **best practices for AI model development**.  
- Introducing **new AI tools** that can enhance productivity.  
- Providing insights into **real-world AI applications** and industry trends.
